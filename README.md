# Network Benchmarker
Network Benchmarker is a server application that monitors network latency over time and displays the results in a graph. I created this to learn more about Node.js, MongoDB, and Vega-Lite.

## Usage
To run Network Benchmarker, run the following commands in the main directory of the project.

```
# Start MongoDB
$ sudo service mongod start

# Start Network Benchmarker
$ node index.js
```
